# Library Management System
A simple library management system...
This is just a study project to develop and understand Hibernate a little bit better. 

This project uses Swing in the front, not really my expertise, the User Interface is kind of a mess right now, but maybe in the future I will have time to improve it and apply some good practices.

So basically we have 3 main Entities here that relate between thenselves : Author, Publisher and Book. 
Hibernate provides powerful object-relational mapping capabilities, allowing to define these relationships between entities.

Note that this is not ready yet, but is a first step in my learning journey.

To get this running, remember to configure the persistence.xml with the correct data from your desired database.
